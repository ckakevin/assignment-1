    I was staring at the sky
  Just looking for a star
  To pray on or wish on
  Or something like that
  <ol>
  <li>I was having a sweet fix
  <li>Of a daydream of a boy</li>
<li>Whose reality, I knew,</li>
<li> Was a hopeless to be had</li>
  <li>But then the dove of hope
<li>Began its downward slope</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
  <li>And I believed for a moment that</li>
  <li>My chances were</li>
  <li>Approaching to be grabbed</li>
  <li> as it came down near,</li>
  So did a weary tear
  I thought it was a bird,
  But it was just a paper bag
  Hunger hurts,
  </ul>
  <div>
  <span style = "color:#FF0000;">
  And I want him so bad, oh it kills
  'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
  I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
  Hunger hurts but starvin' works
  When it costs too much to love
  </span>
  <div>
  And I went crazy again today
  Looking for a strand to climb
  Looking for a little hope
  Baby said he couldn't stay
  Wouldn't put his lips to mine
  A fail to kiss is a fail to cope
  I said, "Honey, I don't feel so good,
  Don't feel justified.<div>

  Come on put a little love here in my void"
  He said "It's all in your head"
  And I said "So's everything"
  But he didn't get it
  I thought he was a man
  But he was just a little boy</a>
