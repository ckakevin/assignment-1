    <p>
    <br>I was staring at the sky</br>
    Just looking for a star
    To pray on or wish on
    Or something like that
  <br>I was having a sweet fix</br>

    Of a daydream of a boy
    Whose reality,

    <br>I knew,
    Was a hopeless to be had
    But then the dove of hope
    Began its downward slope
    And </br>

    <br>I believed for a moment that
    My chances were
    Approaching to be grabbed
    But as it came down near,
    So did a weary tear</br>

    <br>I thought it was a bird,
    But it was just a paper bag
    Hunger hurts,
    And</br>
    <br>I want him so bad, oh it kills</br>
    'Cause
    <br>I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up</br>

    <br>I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
    Hunger hurts but starvin' works</br>
    When it costs too much to love
    And
    <br>I went crazy again today</br>
    Looking for a strand to climb
    Looking for a little hope
    Baby said he couldn't stay
    Wouldn't put his lips to mine
    A fail to kiss is a fail to

    <br>I said, "Honey, I don't feel so good,</br>
    Don't feel justified.
    Come on put a little love here in my void"
    He said "It's all in your head"
    And
    <<br>I said "So's everything"</br>
    But he didn't get it

    <br>I thought he was a man
    But he was just a little boy</br>
    </p>
